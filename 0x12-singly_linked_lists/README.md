A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, stores a value and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the list. The first node of the list is called the head, while the last node is called the tail and its next reference points to null.

Singly linked lists are commonly used to implement dynamic data structures such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. They provide constant time for insertion and deletion at the beginning of the list, but linear time for random access and searching.
