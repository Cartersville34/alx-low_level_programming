A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node in the list contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the list is called the head, while the last node is called the tail. Singly linked lists are commonly used in computer programming as a way to efficiently store and manipulate collections of data. They are particularly useful when the size of the collection is not known ahead of time, as nodes can be added or removed from the list dynamically. The implementation of singly linked lists varies depending on the programming language and use case.
