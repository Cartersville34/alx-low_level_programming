Bit manipulation refers to the process of manipulating bits or binary digits that represent computer data. It involves performing operations such as setting, clearing, flipping, and shifting bits within a binary representation of data.

Some common operations in bit manipulation include:

Bitwise AND (&): sets a bit to 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.

Bitwise OR (|): sets a bit to 1 if either of the corresponding bits is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.

Bitwise NOT (~): flips all the bits in a binary representation of data.

Left shift (<<): moves all the bits in a binary representation to the left by a certain number of positions.

Right shift (>>): moves all the bits in a binary representation to the right by a certain number of positions.

Bit manipulation is often used in low-level programming, such as in device drivers and embedded systems programming. It can also be used in cryptography, compression algorithms, and other applications where compactness and efficiency are important.
